# 2. How tuse R with Google Colab

## Practical Task 1: Setting Up R in Google Colab

### Task 1.1: Create a New Colab Notebook

Open Google Colab.

Sign in with your Google account.

Create a new notebook by clicking on "New Notebook."

### Task 1.2: Set Up R Kernel in Google Colab

* Instructions:
  * Google Colab uses the IPython kernel by default. Trun R code, you'll need tinstall the R kernel using the following commands.
  * Create a new code cell and run the following code tinstall R and essential R packages:

```python
# Install R and necessary packages
!apt-get install -y r-base
!R -e "install.packages('IRkernel'); IRkernel::installspec(user = FALSE)"
```

* Explanation:This installs the base R language and the IRkernel, which allows you trun R code in Colab.

### Task 1.3: Switch tR Kernel

* Instructions:
  * After installing the R kernel, switch tit by selecting "Runtime" > "Change runtime type."
  * Under "Runtime type," select "R" from the "Runtime" dropdown menu and click "Save."

## Practical Task 2: Writing and Running R Code in Google Colab

### Task 2.1: Write and Execute Simple R Code

* Instructions:
  * In your notebook, write a simple R script that prints "Hello, R in Colab!".
  * Create a new code cell and enter the following R code:

```R
print("Hello, R in Colab!")
```

* Task: Run the cell by clicking the "Run" button or pressing Shift + Enter.

### Task 2.2: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations in R

* Instructions:
  * Create a new code cell and write R code tperform basic arithmetic operations.
  * Use the following R code:

```R
a <- 5
b <- 3

# Addition
addition <- a + b
print(paste("Addition: ", addition))

# Subtraction
subtraction <- a - b
print(paste("Subtraction: ", subtraction))

# Multiplication
multiplication <- a * b
print(paste("Multiplication: ", multiplication))

# Division
division <- a / b
print(paste("Division: ", division))
```

* Task: Run the cell and observe the output.

## Practical Task 3: Working with Data in R

### Task 3.1: Load and Inspect a Dataset in R

* Instructions:
  * Use R's built-in `mtcars` dataset for analysis.
  * Create a new code cell and write the following R code tload and inspect the dataset:

```R
# Load the mtcars dataset
data("mtcars")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(mtcars)
```

* Task: Run the cell and inspect the output.

### Task 3.2: Perform Basic Data Manipulation

* Instructions:
  * Create a new code cell tperform data manipulation on the `mtcars` dataset.
  * Use the following R code tcalculate the mean miles per gallon (mpg) for cars with more than 6 cylinders:

```R
# Filter the dataset for cars with more than 6 cylinders
cars_over_6_cyl <- subset(mtcars, cyl > 6)

# Calculate the mean mpg for these cars
mean_mpg <- mean(cars_over_6_cyl$mpg)
print(paste("Mean MPG for cars with more than 6 cylinders: ", mean_mpg))
```

* Task: Run the cell and observe the output.

## Practical Task 4: Visualizing Data in R

### Task 4.1: Create a Basic Plot

* Instructions:
  * Create a new code cell tgenerate a basic scatter plot using the `plot()` function in R.
  * Use the following R code:

```R
# Scatter plot of horsepower (hp) vs. miles per gallon (mpg)
plot(mtcars$hp, mtcars$mpg,
   main = "Scatter plot of HP vs MPG",
   xlab = "Horsepower",
   ylab = "Miles Per Gallon",
   pch = 19, col = "blue")
```

* Task: Run the cell tgenerate the plot.

* Instructions:
  * Install the `ggplot2` package and create a more advanced plot.
  * Create a new code cell and run the following R code:

```R
# Install ggplot2 package
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

# Create a ggplot
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) +
 geom_point(color = "blue", size = 3) +
 geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
 labs(title = "HP vs MPG with Linear Regression Line",
		x = "Horsepower",
		y = "Miles Per Gallon")
```

* Task: Run the cell tgenerate the advanced plot.
